# Aldo's Dot Files

Just my dotfiles for daily use

## Note on VIM
For Plugins/Bundles I'm using the excellent plugin manager [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

Please also note that among the plugins in my vimrc I'm using [YTC (You Complete Me)](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) which requires additional setup depending on the platform. Please refer to its README.
